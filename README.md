# Sample App

The App fetches stories from the hn.algolia.com api based upon the search terms provided by the user. Search terms are stored in redux state. No styling as per brief. I chose to use Redux Toolkit as on the redux website it states, "Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic."

## brief

 1. user can search the api and return the data requested
 2. search terms are stored in redux state
 3. no styling

## to run app

 1. clone/download app
 2. cd into the directory of the app
 3. in console, type the following:

``` bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
